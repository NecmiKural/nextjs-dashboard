## Next.js Dashboard

For this project, I have used the React framework, Nextjs, to make a dashboard.
This is a simplified version of the financial dashboard that has:
- A public home page.
- A login page.
- Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
- The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.
